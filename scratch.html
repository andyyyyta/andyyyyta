        <h1> Student Scramble
        </h1>
        <p>Our game is basically running around to avoid the homework papers. The objective is to last the longest as there will be a timer at the top left. You, the student, will use WASD keys in order to move up, down, left and right. If hit by the homework, the game will be over as the student will have to redo. The longer you last, the harder the game will become.</p>
        <br>
        <p> 1. Describe some programming concepts or structures you learned in this unit that you applied in your game.</p>
        <p> I learned how to program randominess for sprites in the way that the paper shoots out randomly. </p>
        <p> I also learned how to add a score to the top left.</p>
        <br>
        <p> 2. Did you encounter any problems or struggles while working on this project? If you did, how did you solve or overcome them? </p>
        <p> The only problem we struggled with was the initial set-up of all the backgrounds. We eventually overcame our problem by slowly</p>
        <p> working through each step to ensure that we had all the backdrops we needed.</p>
        <br>
        <p> 3. What aspects of your game do you like best? </p>
        <p> I like the challenge of running away from the papers and the fact that you utilize a quick reaction time to win.</p>
        <br>
        <p> 4. If more time was given for you to work on your game, what would you improve or modify about your game?</p>
        <p> I would add music to my game in order to improve it.</p>
